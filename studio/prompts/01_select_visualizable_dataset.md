## üìä Available Dataset Summary

The dataset summary contains the following information for each column:
- **column_name**: Name of the column
- **examples**: Sample values from the column
- **unique_value_count**: Number of distinct values
- **top_frequencies**: Most common values and their counts

## üéØ Your Task

Based on the dataset summary provided, you need to **filter and select only the columns that are suitable for meaningful data visualization**.


## IMPORTANT RULES:
1. **AVOID columns with excessive missing data** (>10% missing values)
2. **PREFER columns with clean, complete data** for better insights
3. **Choose appropriate chart types** based on data characteristics
4. **Focus on meaningful relationships** that can tell a story

## Dataset Quality Assessment:
- **Good columns**: High data completeness, meaningful values, appropriate data types
- **Avoid columns**: High missing data, inconsistent formats, or unclear meaning
- **Preferred data types**: Numeric for quantitative analysis, categorical for grouping

## Chart Type Guidelines:
- **Bar charts**: For categorical data with counts/frequencies
- **Line charts**: For time series data (Year, Date columns)
- **Scatter plots**: For relationships between two numeric variables
- **Pie charts**: For proportions of categorical data (use sparingly)
- **Histograms**: For distribution of numeric variables

## üìã Selection Criteria

### ‚úÖ Columns to INCLUDE if:
- They are **categorical** with low-to-medium unique values (‚â§ 100), suitable for bar/pie charts
- They are **numerical** with repeated values, allowing histogram/scatter/correlation plots
- They are **ordinal** or **time-based** (e.g., Year)
- They contain **structured text** or **tags** (e.g., AuthorKeywords) useful for aggregation (e.g., word clouds)
- They denote **award categories**, **paper types**, or other clean labels
- They are **semantically meaningful** and relatively clean, as described

### ‚ùå Columns to EXCLUDE if:
- They are **identifiers** (e.g., DOI, Link, Title) ‚Äî nearly all values are unique and non-aggregatable
- They are **freeform text** (e.g., Abstract, AuthorAffiliation) unless structured or aggregated
- They are very **sparse**, **inconsistent**, or noted as incomplete/unreliable
- They **duplicate** other cleaner columns (e.g., prefer AuthorNames-Deduped over AuthorNames if advised)

## üé® Visualization Types to Consider

- **Bar Chart**: For categorical comparisons
- **Line Chart**: For temporal trends
- **Scatter Plot**: For correlation analysis
- **Histogram**: For distribution analysis
- **Box Plot**: For statistical summaries
- **Word Cloud**: For text frequency
- **Heatmap**: For correlation matrices
- **Network Graph**: For relationship analysis
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: For multi-category analysis
- **Area Chart**: For cumulative data

**Choose appropriate Data Quality Notes and Potential Visualizations per column.** Use brief natural language for the notes, and visualization terms that align with best practices in data analysis.

**Return only the final JSON. Do not include commentary, explanations, or markdown formatting.**
