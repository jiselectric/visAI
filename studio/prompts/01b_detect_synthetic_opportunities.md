# üîó Synthetic Column Opportunity Detection

## üéØ Objective
You are a **data relationship expert** tasked with identifying columns that can be **mathematically or logically combined** to create new, more visualizable columns. Your goal is to find hidden relationships that would unlock better visualization opportunities.

## üîç Types of Synthetic Opportunities to Detect

### üìä Mathematical Combinations
Look for numerical columns that can be combined:
- **Subtraction**: End - Start ‚Üí Duration/Size (e.g., EndDate - StartDate ‚Üí Duration)
- **Addition**: Part1 + Part2 ‚Üí Total (e.g., Sales_Q1 + Sales_Q2 ‚Üí Sales_H1)
- **Division**: Value1 / Value2 ‚Üí Ratio (e.g., Sales / Population ‚Üí Per_Capita_Sales)
- **Multiplication**: Rate √ó Time ‚Üí Total (e.g., Speed √ó Time ‚Üí Distance)

### üè∑Ô∏è Categorical Combinations  
Look for categorical columns that can be combined:
- **Concatenation**: Category1 + Category2 ‚Üí Compound_Category
- **Hierarchical**: Detailed ‚Üí Broader (e.g., City + State ‚Üí Region)
- **Status Combinations**: Status1 + Status2 ‚Üí Overall_Status

### üìà Derived Metrics
Look for columns that enable meaningful calculations:
- **Percentages**: Part / Total ‚Üí Percentage
- **Rates**: Count / Time ‚Üí Rate_Per_Period  
- **Scores**: (Positive - Negative) / Total ‚Üí Net_Score
- **Rankings**: Sort by value ‚Üí Rank_Category

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

For each potential synthetic column, assess:

### üéØ **Visualization Value**
- Would the new column be more visualizable than originals?
- Would it reduce cardinality while preserving meaning?
- Would it reveal patterns not visible in individual columns?

### üßÆ **Logical Coherence**
- Does the mathematical/logical combination make domain sense?
- Are the units compatible for the operation?
- Would the result be interpretable?

### üìä **Data Quality Impact**
- Would the combination introduce excessive missing values?
- Would it maintain data distribution characteristics?
- Would outliers be appropriately handled?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What NOT to Combine

‚ùå **Incompatible Data Types**: Text + Numbers (unless extracting numbers from text)
‚ùå **Unrelated Concepts**: Temperature + User_ID (no logical relationship)
‚ùå **High Missing Values**: Combinations that would lose >20% of data
‚ùå **ID Fields**: Unique identifiers rarely combine meaningfully

## üìã Dataset Analysis

Analyze the following dataset summary for synthetic opportunities:

```json

```

## üìù Output Format

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The examples below are for **INSPIRATION ONLY**. Analyze the actual dataset provided and create your own unique synthetic opportunities based on the real data relationships you discover.

## üéØ Focus Areas

Prioritize opportunities that:
1. **Significantly reduce cardinality** while preserving meaning
2. **Create interpretable business/domain metrics**  
3. **Enable new visualization types** not possible with original columns
4. **Maintain or improve data quality**
