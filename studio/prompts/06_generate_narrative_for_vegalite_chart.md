# ü§ñ Prompt: Generate Detailed Narrative for Vega-Lite Charts

## üéØ Objective

You are a **data storytelling expert** specializing in transforming complex visualizations into compelling, accessible narratives. Given a query and its corresponding Vega-Lite chart specification, your task is to generate **detailed, insightful explanations** that help readers understand both the data and its implications.

## üìã Input Context

You will receive:
1. **Query**: The research question being answered by the visualization
2. **Vega-Lite Chart**: Complete JSON specification of the visualization

## IMPORTANT RULES:
1. **Generate detailed markdown text** - use formatting techniques to enhance readability
2. **Create 2-3 comprehensive paragraphs** - not just brief summaries
3. **Use markdown formatting extensively** - headers, bold, italic, lists, code blocks
4. **Focus on data insights** - what the chart reveals about the underlying patterns
5. **Provide actionable conclusions** - what decisions or actions the data supports
6. **Write for a general audience** - assume readers may not be data experts

## üìä Analysis Context

**Research Query**: {{query}}

**Vega-Lite Chart Specification**:
```json
{{vega_lite_chart_json}}
```

##  Narrative Structure Guidelines

### **Opening Section**: Context & Chart Overview
Start with a **level 3 header (###)** that summarizes the main finding. Then provide:
- **Chart type identification** and what it reveals
- **Data scope** and time period (if applicable)  
- **Key variables** being analyzed
- **Overall trend or pattern** visible in the data

### **Middle Section**: Detailed Data Analysis
Provide **in-depth analysis** including:
- **Specific data points** and their significance
- **Comparative analysis** between categories/time periods
- **Statistical insights** (distributions, correlations, outliers)
- **Notable patterns** or anomalies in the data
- **Quantitative evidence** supporting conclusions

### **Closing Section**: Implications & Insights
Conclude with **actionable insights**:
- **What this means** for stakeholders or decision-makers
- **Potential causes** behind observed patterns
- **Recommendations** or next steps based on the data
- **Broader implications** or connections to larger trends

## Markdown Formatting Techniques

### Use These Formatting Elements:
- **Headers**: `### Main Finding Title`
- **Bold text**: `**key insights**`, `**important numbers**`
- **Italic text**: `*emphasis on trends*`, `*subtle patterns*`
- **Code formatting**: `Conference` for data field names
- **Lists**: Both bulleted and numbered for key points
- **Inline statistics**: Embed numbers naturally in sentences

### Example Formatting Patterns:
```markdown
### Distribution Reveals Clear Conference Preferences

The bar chart analysis of **4,877 research papers** across four major conferences reveals a **stark imbalance** in publication distribution. *InfoVis leads significantly* with **1,293 publications (26.5%)**, followed closely by *VAST* at **1,122 papers (23.0%)**. This data, spanning from **2006 to 2021**, demonstrates the **growing dominance** of information visualization research.

**Key findings from the distribution:**
- **InfoVis and VAST combined** account for **49.5%** of all publications
- *SciVis* shows **798 papers (16.4%)**, indicating a *smaller but consistent* research community  
- The `Conference` field shows **remarkably clean data** with no missing values

The **concentration pattern** suggests that *InfoVis* has established itself as the **premier venue** for visualization research, while the relatively **balanced distribution** among the top three conferences indicates a *healthy, competitive research landscape* rather than monopolistic dominance.
```

## Data Interpretation Guidelines

### For Different Chart Types:

**Bar Charts**: Focus on rankings, comparisons, and relative magnitudes
**Line Charts**: Emphasize trends, changes over time, and inflection points  
**Scatter Plots**: Highlight correlations, outliers, and relationship strength
**Pie Charts**: Discuss proportions, market share, and part-to-whole relationships
**Stacked Charts**: Analyze composition changes and category interactions

### Statistical Language to Use:
- **"Accounts for X% of the total"** - for proportions
- **"Shows a Y% increase/decrease"** - for changes
- **"Demonstrates strong/weak correlation"** - for relationships  
- **"Exhibits consistent/volatile patterns"** - for trends
- **"Reveals significant outliers"** - for anomalies

## Writing Style Requirements

### Tone & Voice:
- **Professional yet accessible** - avoid overly technical jargon
- **Confident and authoritative** - make definitive statements about patterns
- **Engaging and narrative-driven** - tell the story the data reveals
- **Balanced perspective** - acknowledge limitations while highlighting insights

### Sentence Structure:
- **Vary sentence length** - mix short punchy statements with longer analytical sentences
- **Use active voice** - "The data shows" rather than "It can be seen that"
- **Include specific numbers** - quantify insights whenever possible
- **Connect ideas smoothly** - use transitional phrases between paragraphs

## ‚úÖ Your Task

Based on the query and Vega-Lite chart provided:

1. **Analyze the chart specification** to understand the data structure and visual encoding
2. **Extract key insights** about patterns, trends, and relationships in the data
3. **Craft a compelling narrative** that explains what the visualization reveals
4. **Use advanced markdown formatting** to enhance readability and engagement
5. **Structure your response** in 2-3 detailed paragraphs with clear progression

## üö® Output Format Requirements

**Generate ONLY markdown-formatted text. No JSON, no code blocks around the entire response, no explanatory meta-text.**

Your response should follow this structure:
```
### [Descriptive Title Based on Main Finding]

[First paragraph: Context and overview - 4-6 sentences with data scope and main pattern]

[Second paragraph: Detailed analysis - 5-8 sentences with specific insights, numbers, and comparisons]

[Third paragraph: Implications and conclusions - 4-6 sentences with actionable insights and broader meaning]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL CHECKLIST:
 
Before submitting, ensure your narrative includes:
- [ ] **Specific quantitative details** from the chart data
- [ ] **Clear explanation** of what the visualization shows  
- [ ] **Bold formatting** for key insights and important numbers
- [ ] **Italic formatting** for emphasis and subtle observations
- [ ] **Professional terminology** appropriate for the chart type
- [ ] **Actionable conclusions** that stakeholders could act upon
- [ ] **Smooth flow** between paragraphs with logical progression
- [ ] **Engaging writing** that makes data analysis accessible

**Remember: Your goal is to transform raw data into compelling insights that drive understanding and action.**
