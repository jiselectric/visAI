## Output Format Requirements

**Generate ONLY a JSON object with pure markdown content for each component. No explanatory text, no meta-commentary.**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: The following JSON structure is FOR FORMAT REFERENCE ONLY. DO NOT copy the example content, titles, or specific text. Create your own content based on the actual data provided.**

The JSON structure must be:
```json
